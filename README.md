### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rohan Baijal. Why Blueboy :| ? The simple and not so mysterious answer is that I've been fond of Jazz and Blues for a while :p

I'm from New Delhi and am currently a first year PhD student in the CSE Department at University of Washington.
I am interested inn the intersection of learning and planning to enable robots to perform tasks in complex environments. I hope to work at the intersection of these 2 fields and create something interesting.   
I have some experience with cryptoCurrency as well.
