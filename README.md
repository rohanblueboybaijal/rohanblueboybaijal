### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rohan Baijal. Why Blueboy :| ? The simple and not so mysterious answer is that I've been fond of Jazz and Blues for a while :p

I'm from New Delhi and am currently a Junior Undergraduate in the EECS Department at IIT Kanpur.
I'm currently exploring Robotics and dabble a tiny bit in Deep Learning. I hope to work at the intersection of these 2 fields and create something interesting.   
I have some experience with cryptoCurrency as well.   
I also like to participate in Competitive Programming Contests because it's really fun.   

Collab ? Perhaps something related to Deep Learning or BlockChain applications.
